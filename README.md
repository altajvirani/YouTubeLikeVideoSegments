## Overview

This project integrates Video.js to create a responsive and customizable video player with segmented markers, tooltips, and customized seekbar styling for specified time intervals.

## Project Components

1. **Video Player Initialization:**
   - The project utilizes Video.js to create a responsive and customizable video player.
   - The player is configured with controls, fluid sizing, HTML5 settings, and responsiveness.

2. **Segmented Markers:**
   - Segments of interest within the video are defined in the `segmentsData` array, including start and end times, titles, and content.
   - Segmented markers are manually added to the seekbar, indicating the start times of each segment.
   - Each marker is clickable, allowing users to jump to the corresponding segment.

3. **Customized Seekbar Styling:**
   - The seekbar is styled with a red background for better visibility.
   - Styling is applied using a dynamic CSS class (`marker`) and a corresponding style tag.

4. **Tooltips:**
   - Tooltips are displayed when hovering over the seekbar, providing information about the current time and any segments within that time.
   - The tooltip content is dynamically updated based on the current time and segment data.

5. **Responsive Segments List:**
   - A list of segments is displayed below the video, allowing users to click on a segment title to jump to the corresponding time.

## Usage

1. **Loading the Player:**
   - Include the Video.js library in your project.
   - Initialize the player using the provided configuration, specifying the video source and DRM settings.

2. **Defining Segments:**
   - Modify the `segmentsData` array to define the segments of interest, including start and end times, titles, and content.

3. **Integration of Features:**
   - The `onLoadedMetadata` function handles the integration of segmented markers and styles after the video metadata has loaded.
   - Tooltips are automatically displayed when hovering over the seekbar, providing information about the current time and associated segments.

4. **Responsive Segment List:**
   - The segment list below the video provides an additional means for users to navigate to specific segments.

## Customization

1. **Adjusting Marker Style:**
   - Modify the `markerStyle` CSS block to customize the appearance of segmented markers.

2. **Styling the Tooltip:**
   - Customize the tooltip appearance and content by modifying the `timeTooltip.update` function.

3. **Adapting SegmentsData:**
   - Customize the `segmentsData` array to include the desired segments with specific start and end times, titles, and content.

## Dependencies

- Video.js library

## Additional Features and Updates

- **Custom Thumbnail Generation:**
  - Thumbnails for each frame of the video to enable seek previews.
  - Users can navigate through video frames using the seekbar preview.

## Disadvantages

- **Thumbnail Generation Time:**
  - The current version of the project does not support runtime thumbnail generation. However, potential enhancements could include generating and storing the thumbnail image in the database at the time of video upload. Accessing the pre-generated image from the database would significantly improve efficiency compared to generating it on the client-side every time a user views a video.

## Acknowledgments

- This project leverages the capabilities of the Video.js library for building a feature-rich video player.
- Thumbnail generation is inspired by [flavioribeiro/video-thumbnail-generator](https://github.com/flavioribeiro/video-thumbnail-generator): :camera: Generate thumbnail sprites from videos.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of a Video.js player with segmented markers, tooltips, seekbar preview thumbnails and customized seekbar styling. Developers can adapt and extend this project for their specific video streaming needs, enhancing the user experience with interactive features and navigation options.
